        "question": "What are the requirements for the financing?",

      },
      {
        "question": "How much time should I dedicate to the courses?",
        "answer": "How much time you'll need depends on the program and how fast you want to go.

You can adjust your schedule to make it work for you, and we'll be here to help you stay on track."

        "question": "In what cases would I need to repay the full course price?",
        "answer": "If you haven't completed the learning program or filled out the evaluation questionnaire within 5 working days after the program ends, you'll need to cover the program's cost. If you don't pass the final exam, 'Not Passed' will appear on your Unicamp certificate. But don't stress—you won't need to pay again. Just stay focused, keep up with the material, reach out to your mentor and all be fine;)"

      {
        "question": "What if I can't attend classes on some days?",
        "answer": "No worries. Most sessions are recorded, so you can catch up later. For anything live, just let us know, and we'll help you stay on track."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I access the learning materials after the course ends?",
        "answer": "Yes, after the course ends, you will have access to all the learning materials for another 180 days. This will allow you to review key topics and reinforce the knowledge you've gained."
